The Service is used to manage articles such as create, delete , update as well as perform other required tasks. 


## Project Structure

`/src/*` structure follows default Java structure.

## Development

To start your application in the dev profile, run:

```
./mvnw install
```

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

Note: I have turned off docker and sonar testing for quick delivery along with some dependent functionalities such as circuit breaker,api-gateway,eureka server and other services required in microservice architecture.
